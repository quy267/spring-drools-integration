# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Spring Boot Drools Integration project. ADRs document the architectural decisions made during the development of this project, including the context, decision, and consequences of each choice.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short text documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They help teams understand why certain decisions were made and provide historical context for future development.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Title**: A short phrase describing the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: The positive and negative outcomes of the decision

## How to Create a New ADR

1. Create a new file with the format `XXX-short-title.md` where XXX is the next sequential number
2. Use the ADR template below
3. Update this README.md file to include the new ADR in the index
4. Commit the changes to version control

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the situation that led to this decision]

## Decision

[Describe the architectural decision made]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [List positive outcomes]

### Negative
- [List negative outcomes or trade-offs]

### Neutral
- [List neutral consequences]

## References

- [Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or resources]
```

## Guidelines for Writing ADRs

1. **Keep it concise**: ADRs should be short and focused
2. **Be specific**: Clearly state what decision was made
3. **Explain the context**: Help readers understand why the decision was necessary
4. **Document trade-offs**: Be honest about the negative consequences
5. **Update status**: Mark ADRs as deprecated or superseded when decisions change
6. **Link related ADRs**: Reference other ADRs that are related or affected

## Reviewing ADRs

ADRs should be reviewed by the development team before being accepted. The review process should consider:

- Is the context clearly explained?
- Is the decision well-reasoned?
- Are the consequences realistic and complete?
- Does this conflict with existing ADRs?
- Are there alternative solutions that should be considered?
