# ADR-001: Use Drools as Rule Engine

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The project requires a rule engine to implement business logic for three main use cases:
1. Customer discount calculations
2. Loan approval evaluations  
3. Product recommendations

We needed to choose between several options:
- **Drools**: Open-source rule engine with strong Java integration
- **Easy Rules**: Lightweight Java rules engine
- **Custom implementation**: Build our own rule evaluation system
- **Scripting engines**: Use JavaScript, Groovy, or other scripting languages

Key requirements for the rule engine:
- Integration with Spring Boot
- Support for decision tables (business-friendly rule definition)
- Performance suitable for real-time API responses
- Mature ecosystem with good documentation
- Ability to handle complex business logic
- Support for rule validation and testing

## Decision

We chose **Drools 8.44.0.Final** as the rule engine for this project.

Drools provides:
- Excellent Spring Boot integration
- Native support for Excel-based decision tables
- High performance rule execution
- Mature, well-documented framework
- Strong community support
- Advanced features like rule flow, event processing, and complex event processing
- Built-in rule validation and debugging capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Business-friendly rule definition**: Non-technical users can modify rules using Excel decision tables
- **High performance**: Drools uses the Rete algorithm for efficient rule matching and execution
- **Mature ecosystem**: Extensive documentation, community support, and proven track record in enterprise applications
- **Spring integration**: Seamless integration with Spring Boot through configuration and dependency injection
- **Advanced features**: Support for complex rule scenarios, rule flow, and event processing
- **Debugging capabilities**: Built-in tools for rule debugging and validation
- **Scalability**: Proven performance in high-throughput enterprise environments

### Negative

- **Learning curve**: Drools has a steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with rule engines
- **Complexity**: Can be overkill for simple rule scenarios
- **Memory usage**: Drools can consume significant memory for large rule sets
- **Dependency size**: Adds substantial JAR dependencies to the project
- **Vendor lock-in**: Switching to another rule engine would require significant refactoring

### Neutral

- **Rule syntax**: Requires learning Drools Rule Language (DRL) for advanced scenarios
- **Configuration complexity**: Requires proper configuration for optimal performance
- **Version compatibility**: Need to ensure compatibility between Drools and Spring Boot versions
